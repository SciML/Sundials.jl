# Deprecation Warning Review

## Summary
This document summarizes the review of deprecation warnings in the Sundials.jl package as of January 2025.

## Findings

### Method Definition Warnings (Not Deprecations)
During testing, the following warnings appear:
- `WARNING: Method definition f(Any, Any, Any, Any) overwritten` in various test files

These are **not deprecation warnings** but rather warnings about function redefinition during test execution. This is a common pattern in test suites where similar function names are used across different test files.

### Files with Method Redefinitions:
- `test/cvode_Roberts_dns.jl`: function `f`
- `test/arkstep_Roberts_dns.jl`: function `f` 
- `test/erkstep_nonlin.jl`: function `f`
- `test/kinsol_banded.jl`: functions `f_iip`, `f_oop`
- `test/kinsol_nonlinear_solve.jl`: functions `f_iip`, `f_oop`
- `test/common_interface/ida.jl`: function `f!`
- `test/common_interface/jacobians.jl`: functions `testjac`, `testjac_jac`

## Conclusion
No actual Julia language deprecation warnings were found in Sundials.jl. The package is up-to-date with current Julia practices. The method definition warnings are benign and common in test suites.

## CI Status
✅ Tests pass successfully
✅ No actual deprecation warnings present
